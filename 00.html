                    November 1895. London is shrouded in fog and Sherlock Holmes and
                    Watson pass time restlessly awaiting a new case. "The London
                    criminal is certainly a dull fellow," Sherlock bemoans. "There have
                    been numerous petty thefts," Watson offers in response. Just then a
                    telegram arrives from Sherlock's brother Mycroft with a mysterious
                    case.

                    Arthur Cadogan West was found dead, head crushed in on train tracks
                    at Aldgate Station at 6AM Tuesday morning. West worked at Woolwich
                    Arsenal on the Bruce-Partington submarine, a secret military
                    project. Plans for the submarine had been stolen and seven of the
                    ten missing papers were found in West's possession. Mycroft implores
                     Sherlock to take the case and recover the three missing papers.

                    Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
                    deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to Aldgate
                    Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
                    a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
                    Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
                    be in England, with full address."
